# 24-3-timer

Realize the work of an accurate timer with visual feedback.
At the beginning of the program, the user enters the number of minutes and seconds to be recorded on the timer and presses "Enter".
After that, the countdown begins, which is immediately and consistently reported to the user. The output format is the same as when entering the interval: minutes and seconds.
As soon as the countdown on the timer runs out, the program reports this by outputting a special message to the console. A message instead of an audio signal might look like this: DING! DING! DING!
